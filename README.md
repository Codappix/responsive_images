# TYPO3 Extension to generate perfectly sized responsive images

This extension provides the classes to generate the config of the responsive images.

This is by no means finished. At the moment this extension only provides the classes.
The configuration needs to be handled for each content element separately.

In this development state the extension is only used in one project.

##  Missing Features

The extension does not yet:
- work out of the box without configuration.
- support content block grids.
- provide flexible enough configuration for more use cases.
- support EXT:fluid_styled_content.
